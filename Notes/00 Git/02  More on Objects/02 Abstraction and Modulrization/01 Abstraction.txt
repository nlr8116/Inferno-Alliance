Abstraction:
    -The ability to ignore the details of parts of a system and focus on a higher level

Ex: Google Maps Zoom level

Ex: .append() 
    -We dont usually care how it adds a value to a list just that it adds it 
    -At a lower level of abstraction, where we are very concerned with performence, we might care about how it adds a value to the list
