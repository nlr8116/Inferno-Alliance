Coupling and cohesion

Unit:
A unit is any resonable self-contained component 
Ex: a function 
Ex: a class
Ex: a file(i.e. python files, a package)
Ex: A directory (mutiple python files, a package)

coupling:
The linking of two seperate units
Goal is to have loosely coupled code(little dependency)
Tightly couping units are genereally considered bad practice (lots of dependency)
Tightly coupling units can make code more difficult to maintain

Cohesion:
referes to the numebr of an diversity of tasks that a single unit is responsible for 
highly cohesive code means a unit is only resonable for 1 single tasks

lwo cohesion means a unit is responsible for lots of takes
low cohesive code
we like high cohesion
